# CryptoCowboy - REMASTERED
## Back due to popular demand!

Free tech support is available on my Discord channel:

##	Why the Remaster?
The original CC source code is awful; It's really bad, but it *does* work.

I would like to provide the old ComputerCowboy experience but for 2022.

My computing wizardry powers have leveled up and I would like to integrate that experience into restoring CC to it's former glory.

I'm proud of the functionality CC provided but not proud of showing off the nuts and bolts under the hood. Source code readability will see a big improvement here.

For those that would like to better understand the innerworkings of a XRPL trading bot, this remaster offers a good starting point.

##	What happened to the original source code?
If you want the unadulterated original source code, check out the original commit on this repository; that is the starting point for this remaster. Use at your own risk.

Note: Tech support will only be provided for features that are documented in the latest version of this README.md file.

##	Installation

	If you're reading this, new installation instructions for CC will be provided soon.

##	What about your new project, **AssetStream**?
This remaster is just the appetizer for **AssetStream**.

Once this restoration project is complete, no new features will be added to CryptoCowboy and the project will be put on ice.

Work on AssetStream is currently on hold until this remaster is completed.
**AssetStream's** feature set is a superset of CryptoCowboy's and will be the recommended path forward once feature parity has been met.
