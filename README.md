	Due to popular demand, I have decided to re-implement the original CryptoCowboy software.

	This version will be a complete re-write and many implementation details will change but the core functionality will remain the same.

	Additionally, I will offer full tech support for this REMASTERED version.

	Since the goal is to re-implement the original, I will not be accepting feature requests. For new features, follow my 'AssetStream' project which will be posting updates soon.

	For access to the original source code, check out the initial commit from this repository.

	If no updates are provided after this one, you are looking at the original source code. (Or at least some version of it)
